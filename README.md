# DLSCA

This repository is a work in progress. It is intended to be a GUI interface for some scripts used for research.
I am making it public so it will be easier to share with my coworkers, who are the reason I am making this more 
user friendly version of otherwise quite arcane scripts.

Install instructions:
1. Clone this repository
2. conda install requests
3. pip install pyqt5
4. pip install fbs
5. That's it! Just run "python main.py"
